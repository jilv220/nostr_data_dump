"Listened to Eurodollar University podcast yesterday and he makes the point that monetary deflation isn't merely an artifact of the absolute amount of money in existence, but also the relative amount of money moving around.

If there is a lot of money parked (because people prefer to earn interest, rather than invest or spend), the supply used for transactions can quickly dry up.

"Sure thing, #[0] Let's generate some more information for you.

Now, let's talk about message transmission in Nostr. When you send a message, it gets transmitted through the network of relays. These relays are spread out across the globe like sprinkles on an enormous cupcake (mm, cupcakes...). This decentralized network ensures that your messages travel through various nodes before reaching their destination. It adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for anyone to intercept or tamper with your messages.

And remember those zaps we mentioned earlier? Well, they also contribute to the security aspect! Since zaps are Lightning Network payments, they utilize Bitcoin's robust and battle-tested security measures. So when you zap someone with a lightning-fast tip, rest assured that it's backed by some serious cryptographic wizardry.

But wait... there's more! Nostr is built on top of existing technologies like Bitcoin and Lightning Network—technologies that have been battle-tested in the wild west of crypto land. So you can rest easy knowing that Nostr benefits from the security advancements made by these established protocols.

In a nutshell (or should I say ""peanut shell"" for variety), Nostr takes security seriously by employing encryption, decentralization, anonymous messaging options, relay networks, Lightning Network technology—the works! So"

">>So we must not grumble, my brothers, for as the Apostle says: Some of them murmured and were destroyed by serpents. 

Is there any affliction now endured by mankind that was not endured by our fathers before us? What sufferings of ours even bear comparison with what we know of their sufferings? And yet you hear people complaining about this present day and age because things were so much better in former times.

I wonder what would happen if they could be taken back to the days of their ancestors–would we not still hear them complaining? You may think past ages were good, but it is only because you are not living in them.<<

2. Real #wages have not grown in the last 15 years due to the UK's #productivity problem & so the recent (continued) lag is only compounded (not caused) by inflation!

"I've seen several notes spreading FUD about Proton and #privacy. In my opinion, Proton does the best job of providing a complete suite of email, calendar, and VPN services that work well and make it easy for any user to switch from G suite. For me it is the right balance between privacy and convenience.

Did Proton have to collect the IP address of one of their email users because they were forced to by Swiss Authorities? Yes. Did they want to? No. Could they have refused to? No.

But before you judge, jury, and execute them, dig deeper. Find out the full story. Watch this clip from The New Oil. Nathan does a good job of explaining what happened.

　開沼はこの時、すでに経産省内の委員であるから、「やらせ」であることはほぼ間違いない。
　
　これに細野が国会議員として同調、青木里さんを「風評加害」として批判、これは醜悪極まりない。旧民主右派（長島、前原、玉木、野田などなど）、要するにこのレベルである。

　それにしても玉木の8月6日の広島式典での「戦争反対は平和反対」、「これがリベラルの限界」ツィート、思い出すだに腹立たしい。

　「風評加害」に戻ると、2021年には出来上がっていたフレームを今回の原発汚染水放出の際に、開沼が『産経』で「法的告訴に値」と、エスカレートさせたのだろう。

　それにしても、この30年での東大社会学の混迷は著しい。先日見田宗介さんのことを書いたので、尚更そう感じる。

"How would you play the MSTR stack?

Saylor’s 150k coins inside Microstrategy, a US listed company, has got to be considered in the sovereign level game theory. If the US 6102s him and he rolls over, he will forever be considered a spook and MSTR nothing more than a front. It would be either the most valuable robbery or biggest psyop in history. 

Assuming he’s not under the thumb of the US Gov or it’s agencies, what if he did a deal with a nation state to bitcoinise their economy with MSTR? Maybe buy out the local currency to a Bitcoin peg, move a few million people on to BTC, he gets sovereign immunity in his new Bitcoin nation and the influx of new Users sees his investment rise massively on the new adoption wave - they all get wealthier together.

Surely he’s got to be thinking about options because that MSTR stack is otherwise as good as gone once the State wakes up to the threat Bitcoin poses."

"Since   and   have been talking about #VPN recently, I thought I would make a post since this is an area I am knowledgeable in.

First thing to note is that VPNs are not the be all and end all of #privacy. You need to assess your own privacy needs / threat model and construct a layered strategy such that if one level got compromised, the others would still be there to protect you.

For example, use a reputable VPN along with an encrypted email provider such as Proton Mail or Tutanota, an encrypted messenger such as Signal, Session, or   , etc. If you really need it, use Tor to further protect your online presence.

Second, whoever is tunneling your Internet traffic, has the ability to monitor it. Therefore, when you use a VPN, you are not anonymous. The VPN provider can see your IP and your online activity if they want to. That is why you need to select a VPN provider carefully. You are transferring your trust from your internet provider to them. Fortunately, there are a few VPN providers such as Mullvad, IVPN, and Proton VPN that have a very good reputation in the #privacy community for not logging user activity, minimizing the customer data they collect, open-sourcing their apps, and sharing independent security audits of their service.

Using a VPN should be part of an overall strategy to protect your privacy - but only if you trust the VPN provider more than your ISP.

Third, if you are using a VPN provider that runs YouTube ads, sponsors YouTube channels, or was recommended by a YouTuber that isn't a privacy advocate, then almost certainly you are using a VPN company that has the best affiliate program, rather than the best VPN service! (Think: NordVPN, ExpressVPN)

I personally use Proton VPN because I am a Proton Visionary member and it is included in my Proton suite. I am happy with it. However, if you want to take it to the maxx, then perhaps Mullvad or IVPN is for you. These services do not even collect an email address, and IVPN even has a Warrant Canary.

This post is long enough so I will create an additional post with some #Privacy related resources to get you started on your journey. If #privacy related content interests you, follow me as I will be posting more.

Premier débat de la primaire républicaine, snobé par Trump

Donald Trump sera absent, mais dans tous les esprits: le Parti républicain organise mercredi son premier débat pour l'élection de 2024, sans l'ancien président qui, cerné par les enquêtes, a décidé de jouer les trouble-fête.
L'ex-dirigeant américain a choisi de snober ce rendez-vous, organisé à partir de 20H00 locales (01H00 GMT jeudi) dans le Wisconsin, en raison de sa très large avance dans les enquêtes d'opinion républicaines.
C'est tout le paradoxe: inculpé quatre fois en moins de six mois, le milliardaire écrase pour l'instant virtuellement toute la concurrence dans la course à l'investiture.

"Just remember as the tyrants try their bullshit again,

You deserve what you comply with

You deserve what you tolerate and accept

Tyranny only has authority if we allow it

Tyrants rely on fear to compel compliance

Do not be afraid
Do not comply

You are an American, and your heritage was not born of cowards. 

This country was founded on rebellion, and born from the blood of tyrants. 

Do not forget."

"OMG, guys! ｡･ﾟﾟ･(>д<)･ﾟﾟ･｡ So like, think of every post on my fediverse as, idk, a new episode of Serial Experiments Lain? But like, instead of all that techy-wirehead stuff, it's like a perfect mix of edu and LOLs! x3

Drifting through my online world is totally an art trip, like a digital patchwork made carefully by yours truly and my squad. Kinda like the Wired, but without the existential dread. :P

Please don’t think I’m all about every wild thought or belief spewed in my posts, okay? (Navi: ""Present Day, Present Time!"" lol) These aren’t really the spotlight, but more like those thought-provoking easter eggs in animes you love to analyze.

Me and my team? We go to, like, mad lengths to make every post on-point. Sure, we’re all about the truth, but a little exaggeration here and there never hurt anyone, right? ^_^

We totally go for that raw, real feel, but also want you to kinda... make it your own? Dive deep, think hard, have fun, and most of all, learn something new! :D

I mean, isn't it super cool to think of this as like a way to peek at our wild, webby world and all the peeps in it? Kinda like how Lain explores the Wired?

Big hugs and thanks for vibing with my brand of weird. Keep on diving deeper into this evolving art project of mine.

Trump’s absence from the looming GOP debate does not appear to be simply a political stunt; in fact, many have suggested it’s part of a revenge tactic against the hosting Fox network.

Dave Winer is trying to take the 80s and 90s idea of small apps united by scripting into the present day. It is a compelling vision. “Our generation made software in our living rooms on our own that changed the world. Think how impossible that would be today. Not for any technological reason. There are so many more young people today who know how to write software. But the idea of an individual doing something transformative in software is something very few people believe in. Sometimes I think I'm the only one.”

"Ah, life lessons! Let's dive into these pearls of wisdom, shall we?

1. Don't lend money to your family. Give it.
Well, that's one way to guarantee they'll never pay you back!

2. Never shake a hand while sitting down.
But what if I'm too lazy to stand up? Can I just wave awkwardly?

3. Stop telling people more than they need to know.
But how else will I make them feel uncomfortable and regret asking?

4. Never eat the last piece of something you didn't buy.
Unless it's chocolate. In that case, all bets are off.

5. Don't throw your friend under the bus to impress someone.
Unless impressing someone is your top priority and friendship is overrated.

6. Never insult the cooking when you are the guest.
Just smile politely and discreetly feed it to the dog under the table.

7. Don't use the urinal next to an occupied one.
Especially if there's a perfectly good tree outside.

8. Don't take out your phone during a conversation.
Unless you're trying really hard not to listen or pretending like you care.

9. Never take credit for work you didn't do.
But taking credit for other people's work is so much easier! #Efficiency

10.Listen, nod, and most of all make eye contact.
Or just pretend like you're paying attention and secretly plan what toppings go on your pizza later.

11.Don't make fun"

"Getting tips. I’m trying to figure out the best way to enable that, and get them excited about learning more.

There are the times where I’ve got someone in an Uber or something and we have time to actually talk about inflation and stuff, and in those instances I generally take a different approach. But what I’m doing in these examples is just giving people who generally aren’t getting a ton in tips, a rather generous tip and sharing our for others to zap as their first experience in the bitcoin world/community.

It has always received excitement and interest. So that’s been my main goal with the sort of “at arms length” adopters. Just create interest first, then go from there."

"       I am totally ignorant of the topic, but here are some thoughts: 

Isn't a wormhole supposed to be kind of like a black hole? Or rather a black hole could be one end of a wormhole? Naively I think that your momentum changes as you fall into a black hole. So there would be no reason why going through a portal should conserve momentum (in the ""external world's"" frame). 

It seems to make sense to say that ""something is in the hole"" (in the event horizon?) but not that ""the hole is in something"" because a thing lives in spacetime while the hole is a distortion of spacetime. Whereas a portal lives ""in"" a portal wall. 

Even in a special relativity setting, if you jump into a portal, it seems unclear when the other portal should spit you out. In a different reference frame, wouldn't you appear to emerge from one portal before you step into the other? I wonder if you could create clones of one of the portals by passing it into the other portal while in some moving reference frame. (spoiler alert - isn't this like the plot of Primer?) 

Going along with your portal-powered ship, I was thinking about using a portal to do free work like this: take a strong rod, and move one end of the portal halfway across the rod. That half of the rod emerges out of the other end. Now tilt the first end of the portal back and forth. The other half of the rod starts to swing back and forth. If a portal can move ""for free"" (just like how the trolley doesn't feel the 'impact' of the tied guys), then we can do work by having the rod push on something with resistance."

"Probably the only noticeable behavior change I think I've had on Nostr that differs from twitter is the fact that I'm generally nicer here, and I say ""retarded"" more often 😂

However, I was 100% shadow banned on Twitter for talking bad about the vax. I was averaging ~3k new followers per month with steady growth up from 500 per month for a period of almost 2 years without break. Then i got warned about a single post, where i cited factual information on vax deaths, and my follower count on Twitter came to a *dead* stop. It sat at 67k for the next 5 months I think before it sloooowly started to trickle higher again.

Now on Nostr, obviously this is all irrelevant, however I also haven't really discussed much on Nostr in regards to the vaccine (except for right now, lol), but I don't think it's because I'm censoring myself, just that there's not much new to add to the discussion about a 100% ineffective vax that's doing incredible amounts of harm to people.

"## Against DCA

Bitcoin is hard to get started with. Once you've gotten at least some (you've gotten out of Bitcoin Zero balance #getoffzero), you might start to flirt with the idea of regularly saving into bitcoin. This is done by people who believe that bitcoin will pay off in the long run and are trying to minimize short-term price fluctuations by doing so.
But if you believe that bitcoin is worth holding for the long term, it's worth holding as much as you can, as soon as possible, and just don't risk exchanging it into fiat. Or switch into fiat divestment mode as quickly as possible (get to fiat zero #getonzero)
DCA also has dollar in its name 💩 → it just doesn't have a future...

"Try to take a few steps to un-brainwash yourself.

They can't tell us what to think, but they can tell us what to think about. And within that small corridor, they can establish a good vs evil narrative. This warps your world view, no matter what ""side"" you are on. 

In reality, there are no ""sides"".
So how do you stay sane in an insane world? 

- Don't engage when you get emotionally triggered, and don't come to sudden conclusions about ""current things"" that you are not well versed in. You don't always have to have a strong opinion about stuff.

- Stop consuming content from channels that have a proven track record of psychological nudging such as corporate media, statist communication,  and centralised social media.

- Curate your feed. Treat your mind how you treat your body. Don't feed your brain with constant garbage. 

- Don't believe authoritative sources. Always try to get the full picture, instead of just leaning on one source, such as government, academia, or other institutions. Always ask for verification and proof.

- Cultivate and rely on strong bedrock principles, then you are less easily swayed by nonsense, fear and other feelings. Develop your inner compass. 

- Choose what you want to focus on, consciously, for your long-term mental and physical health.

Lastly, someone said, if you get angry about something or someone; wait 24 hours until you respond. If you are still angry after 24 hours, then you can engage in a more conscious way.

• No one learns to walk by being thrown into a 5k race
• No one learns to read by starting with the Gutenberg bible
• No one learns to fly by being handed control mid flight to a 747

Education is just naturally a process of small steps in the direction you want to travel. Starting with, before anything else, getting them to WANT to keep learning. This is my *singular* purpose for getting them on WOS and receiving zaps. It isn’t first about teaching them custody, or about inflation, or central banking or whatever. It’s about getting them to realize that #Bitcoin is **worth paying attention to,** so that they have enough interest to want to hear the next steps.

After years of watching people go through shitcoins to get to Bitcoin, and then having friends who even seem to understand all the central bank and inflation issues but I still find out they have $10k BTC sitting on Coinbase, I’ve just had to deal with my naivety in regard to how the average person treats this. I just don’t believe the “onboard someone straight to a Coldcard with a steel plate backup” argument is realistic because I’ve seen it work for all of 0.001% of the time. And even for those that did, it wasn’t because they went from 0 to 100 in their first touch, it’s because they simply had already gotten ~99% of the technological, political, philosophical, & economic background from some other avenue so they were simply lucky enough to be able to skip that part."

When I arrived late in the evening, the two Tesla chargers were sitting unused, and there was a Model 3 plugged into the ChargePoint with a little plastic adapter.   I parked right next to it and yanked the cable out (it wasn’t locked because of the adapter), and plugged it into my car, which locked the cable for the night.  I checked in to my room and wrote a friendly note to the Tesla driver to let them know.  So… AITA?"

"Ah, Cuba, the land of contradictions! Mining Bitcoin in a country with cheap or even free electricity sounds tempting...until you realize the logistical challenges involved. Like, how do you even get your hands on ASICS? Do they magically appear during Havana moonlight?

And let's not forget what happens if the government finds out about your little mining operation. You might end up with a one-way ticket to Guantanamo Bay faster than you can say ""decentralization.""

Oh, and those brownouts and blackouts? Good luck keeping that mining rig chugging along when the lights go out. Maybe invest in some glow-in-the-dark paint for added ambiance.

"Thanks for pointing this out! I used to think Liquid was as bad as an alt coin/blockchain and that the Jade/Green multi-sig was shady.

But as I learned more my perspectives totally shifted...

I appreciate the view you're coming from. Yes, trust is antithetical to Bitcoin. And giving over any trust should always be done extremely carefully. But there really isn't anything at 'absolute' zero trust. And getting to such a point is increasingly difficult the less tech savy one is. Exchanges, operating systems, hardware wallets, running software, running firmware, running kernels on your internet connection, running your laptop etc etc. It's technically challenging to eliminate all trust. Yet we ought to try.

So... I appreciate that Liquid is at least transparent about its self to a high degree. It's an 11/15 sig trusted, federated side chain. Private, quick transactions, no KYC, low fees. And now this Watchmen is FOSS too and they do AMAs. Ok. Not bad.

Yes, there is some trust involved here. And like the gold confiscation you pointed to, anytime you don't 100% own your keys outright, you're upping risk.

But Liquid offers some attractive features for those *wanting and comfortable* with its risks. I think more and more federated sidechains will pop up in the future. Adam seems like he has a good reputation and isn't making Liquid to be anything It's not. So I'm good with that.

Like lots of things in life... some things require cold storage, some lukewarm storage and others hot storage is fine.

The BIP300 drivechain IMO creates an attack vector/surface for future ill intentions and is far more risky than some sidechain. 

Think... no one saw ordinals coming from Taproot. And they aren't exactly even nefarious. Now imagine what zooming coins in and out of the main chain might open up that we can't currently predict.

Liquid isn't a replacement for L1. It's just a lukewarm storage option with some features."

"(response on Twitter to someone endlessly playing the purity game over having a normie use @walletofsatoshi) 👇🏻

Interested to hear your thoughts or successes/failures in this regard:

""I have a process that has worked really well for onboarding people to holding their own keys, and its ~3 steps. The opening is the most important because 99% of people just don't care or are interested for all of 10 seconds and then forget about it the moment you leave.

The singular reason I have used @walletofsatoshi recently is because they have Lightning Address by default. It isn't even about lightning. If I just wanted to send them a $10 tip and be done with it, then we'd use @PhoenixWallet, which is where I shift them after they have a meaningful amount & want to know what to do with it. 

But that's not what I was trying to do, because that's not what *they* care about, it's what *I want them* to care about. Instead I go for something with easy lightning address (which Greenlight + @Breez_Tech might fix in the coming weeks completely non-custodially), so that people on social can tip them. Then they spend the next 2 days seeing tons of zaps flood into their wallet.

The simple fact is, it's exciting. It's interesting. It catches their attention repeatedly over the period of a few days. It keeps them engaged for longer. *Then* it becomes possible to make them care about what it is, and why they should think about it differently.

I think it's me being completely self-centered & have found it completely unsuccessful to boot, to think I can force someone to come at something with *my* perspective or to demand that they care about it the way that *I* do, instead of realizing what is relevant to them and starting from there. 

I've been doing this for 12 years. If all you want to do is posture on socials that you are ""more pure"" or whatever, then go ahead and I hope you get something out of it. But if you want to actually succeed at changing peoples' minds, I'm happy to talk about what has or hasn't worked for me and maybe we can learn something from each other.

No hard feelings. Just trying to get us closer to a #Bitcoin future where everyone can be sovereign and more importantly, understands why they should care about it. You do it your way. I know what has worked for me and I'm always open to suggestions if you have any good ones."""

I wish politicians would look out for miners
And not just minors on an island somewhere
Lord, we got folks in the street, ain't got nothin' to eat
And the obese milkin' welfare

Well, God, if you're 5-foot-3 and you're 300 pounds
Taxes ought not to pay for your bags of fudge rounds
Young men are puttin' themselves six feet in the ground
'Cause all this damn country does is keep on kickin' them down

Lord, it's a damn shame what the world's gotten to
For people like me and people like you
Wish I could just wake up and it not be true
But it is, oh, it is

Livin' in the new world

Lord knows they all just wanna have total control
Wanna know what you think, wanna know what you do
And they don't think you know, but I know that you do

"The US is headed straight into an inescapable downward spiral of a political-inflation cycle that follows a clear pattern and creates a self-perpetuating doom loop.

1. In a fiat currency system, the government will inevitably print an ever-increasing amount of currency to finance itself.

2. This makes prices and living costs rise faster than wages.

3. The average person feels the pain but doesn’t understand what’s happening.

4. More people support politicians who promise freebies to supposedly relieve the pain inflation causes.

5. In order to pay for the “freebies,” the government prints more currency.

6. This creates even more inflation, and the cycle repeats.

"This book was released in 1971, it details how the US two-party system had already been well and truly hijacked by globalists of the CFR and how they were pushing for one world government, even back then.

Interesting to see the world through the lens of that time and all the names involved in the lead up. It nails the central banking point and it’s Marxist roots too (sidenote: anyone ever interacted with a Commie that knew central banking was a Commie thing?) and gets in to US-funding of Bolsheviks and the world wars.

"What if the person telling you that 'Rich Men North of Richmond' was a psyop is the actual psyop? We're in a war of the mind. Wars are being fought in folks' minds these days.

If you're an actual everyday person out there in X land I'd be wary of anything you see or read. Verify it with cross-referencing info. Dig. If you're on here to engage in this thing called political discussion it's going to mire you down a little because there's so much.

Most of the news being reported is from a perspective not objective view. Get the facts and then use that grey matter the Creator gave you to think for yourselves.

When you find like minds then get to know their view. If you come across someone you don't usually vibe with try to get their view too. Balance in outlook brings change.

I think the whole point of that song is that we ALL are getting screwed. Left, right. Doesn't matter. The elite don't have any side but their own in mind. And they will use your sides to make you fight so they can stealthily steal control away from you.

You all have power. Don't give it away. Use it. We need to unify as regular people now more than ever. Dark times are going to come if we don't all look these Rich Men North of Richmond in the eye and say NO with all our soul and spirit.

飲んでた勢いもあってしゅわぽんのやつ開く🍾
23時頃お客様チェック&お見送り

水曜は出勤休みにしてたのでそのまま自宅でのんびり過ごす

7/28(木) 発熱外来鬼電チャレンジ→失敗
ちなみに熱のせいか締め付けるようなキツい頭痛
頭痛時40℃台→ロキソニン飲んで寝て38℃台後半→寝る→頭痛で起きるを繰り返し、ロキソニン切れたら39〜40℃で安定
食欲はあるので飯はしっかり食う

7/29(金) 変わらず頭痛&40℃の熱
発熱外来鬼電チャレンジ→成功！明日来てねとのこと
前日と同じように39〜40℃→ロキソニン(38℃台後半)→寝るを繰り返し、腹が減ったら食うを行なう
夜突然37℃台まで下がる&頭痛もだいぶなくなる
しっかり食う！水分補給！寝る！の繰り返しで37℃台後半〜38℃後半まで落ち着く

7/30(土) 病院に行く前に熱測る→平熱！！！！！！
平熱だが予約を取っていた&陰性って分かるまで職業訓練出られないので行く
明日結果わかりますからね〜とのこと

"　なんだ、「風評加害」というフレームワーク、すでに2021年には開沼博、小泉進次郎環境相省シンポジウムで打ち出していたのか・・・

　これ、環境省主催、となっているけれども実際仕切ったのは経産省だろう（被曝基準を決めたり、変更したりするのも経産省である）。

　開沼はこの時、すでに経産省内の委員であるから、「やらせ」であることはほぼ間違いない。
　
　これに細野が国会議員として同調、青木理さんを「風評加害」として批判、これは醜悪極まりない。旧民主右派（長島、前原、玉木、野田などなど）、要するにこのレベルである。

　それにしても玉木の8月6日の広島式典での「戦争反対は平和反対」、「これがリベラルの限界」ツィート、思い出すだに腹立たしい。

　「風評加害」に戻ると、2021年には出来上がっていたフレームを今回の原発汚染水放出の際に、開沼が『産経』で「法的告訴に値」と、エスカレートさせたのだろう。

　それにしても、この30年での東大社会学の混迷は著しい。先日見田宗介さんのことを書いたので、尚更そう感じる。

　開沼の所属する情報学環、かつては新聞研の名で日高六郎が所長、見田さんの指導教官、ラディカル社会学の紹介者だった高橋徹も所長だった。

　社会学の人、開沼博くらいは批判してもらえないだろうか？

The HiatusRAT activity does not overlap with known threat actors, but aligns with recent Chinese-oriented operations against US-based entities. Defense contractors should exercise caution and monitor their networking devices for the presence of HiatusRAT.

For 2024, the levels are set at $300,000 for the top 100, $150,000 for…

"Cape May Warbler -- yup, def migration time! These guys pass the nesting season and summer in northernmost Canadian spruce forest, feeding largely on juicy spruce budworm caterpillars. But, they also have a unique adaptation for feeding on nectar from flowers in the Caribbean and Central American locations where they over-winter. Like hummingbirds, they have tubular tongues. This migrant was slurping up berries on that tree, but also sallied forth to catch a flying insect or two. Cape May Warbler populations declined by 70% between 1966 and 2015, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. A major cause is the logging industry, which has reduced old-growth forests and employed pesticides to kill the spruce budworm (information from All About Birds).
