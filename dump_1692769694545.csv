"Depends.
Lots of disabled people have children, but not everyone can. And not everyone finds a mate, in time.
I don't actually believe everyone should marry and have children because my religion celebrates celebacy.

The problem is more that the social welfare system promotes childlessness and idleness, so the numbers are inflated beyond the natural rate."

">>So we must not grumble, my brothers, for as the Apostle says: Some of them murmured and were destroyed by serpents. 

Is there any affliction now endured by mankind that was not endured by our fathers before us? What sufferings of ours even bear comparison with what we know of their sufferings? And yet you hear people complaining about this present day and age because things were so much better in former times.

I wonder what would happen if they could be taken back to the days of their ancestors–would we not still hear them complaining? You may think past ages were good, but it is only because you are not living in them.<<

"""The greatest revolution of National Socialism is to have opened the gate of knowledge to the fact that all the errors and mistakes of man are temporal and thus capable of improvement, except for one:

The error about the importance of the preservation of his blood, his kind and thus of the form given to him by God and the being given to him by God. We humans do not have to right ourselves about why Providence created the races, but only to recognize that it punishes those who disregard its creation.

Unspeakable suffering and misery have come upon humanity because it lost this insight, which is deeply anchored in instinct, through poor intellectual half-education. This will not lead to an alienation of the peoples, but on the contrary to a true mutual understanding for the first time!

But it will also prevent the Jewish people, under the mask of a respectful citizen of the world, from inwardly disintegrating all the other peoples and thereby trying to dominate them!""

Ce portrait d’une femme jugée pour le meurtre de son mari est d’une subtilité “étourdissante”, a écrit le critique ciné du “Daily Telegraph” après avoir découvert le thriller sur la Croisette.

"How would you play the MSTR stack?

Saylor’s 150k coins inside Microstrategy, a US listed company, has got to be considered in the sovereign level game theory. If the US 6102s him and he rolls over, he will forever be considered a spook and MSTR nothing more than a front. It would be either the most valuable robbery or biggest psyop in history. 

Assuming he’s not under the thumb of the US Gov or it’s agencies, what if he did a deal with a nation state to bitcoinise their economy with MSTR? Maybe buy out the local currency to a Bitcoin peg, move a few million people on to BTC, he gets sovereign immunity in his new Bitcoin nation and the influx of new Users sees his investment rise massively on the new adoption wave - they all get wealthier together.

Surely he’s got to be thinking about options because that MSTR stack is otherwise as good as gone once the State wakes up to the threat Bitcoin poses."

"I think major clients should have their own proper local databases.

It would greatly enhance the user experience, smooth feed and more reliability. 

This would also reduce internet and battery usage, as notes and other stuff wouldn't need to be fetched every time also resulting in a smooth feed.

A local database is also the best personal realtime backup anyone can have. It can also keep your relay data up-to-date.

Good Local Database can improve all these things without any external server!

"Since   and   have been talking about #VPN recently, I thought I would make a post since this is an area I am knowledgeable in.

First thing to note is that VPNs are not the be all and end all of #privacy. You need to assess your own privacy needs / threat model and construct a layered strategy such that if one level got compromised, the others would still be there to protect you.

For example, use a reputable VPN along with an encrypted email provider such as Proton Mail or Tutanota, an encrypted messenger such as Signal, Session, or   , etc. If you really need it, use Tor to further protect your online presence.

Second, whoever is tunneling your Internet traffic, has the ability to monitor it. Therefore, when you use a VPN, you are not anonymous. The VPN provider can see your IP and your online activity if they want to. That is why you need to select a VPN provider carefully. You are transferring your trust from your internet provider to them. Fortunately, there are a few VPN providers such as Mullvad, IVPN, and Proton VPN that have a very good reputation in the #privacy community for not logging user activity, minimizing the customer data they collect, open-sourcing their apps, and sharing independent security audits of their service.

Using a VPN should be part of an overall strategy to protect your privacy - but only if you trust the VPN provider more than your ISP.

Third, if you are using a VPN provider that runs YouTube ads, sponsors YouTube channels, or was recommended by a YouTuber that isn't a privacy advocate, then almost certainly you are using a VPN company that has the best affiliate program, rather than the best VPN service! (Think: NordVPN, ExpressVPN)

I personally use Proton VPN because I am a Proton Visionary member and it is included in my Proton suite. I am happy with it. However, if you want to take it to the maxx, then perhaps Mullvad or IVPN is for you. These services do not even collect an email address, and IVPN even has a Warrant Canary.

This post is long enough so I will create an additional post with some #Privacy related resources to get you started on your journey. If #privacy related content interests you, follow me as I will be posting more.

"Sure thing, #[0] Let's generate some more information for you.

Now, let's talk about message transmission in Nostr. When you send a message, it gets transmitted through the network of relays. These relays are spread out across the globe like sprinkles on an enormous cupcake (mm, cupcakes...). This decentralized network ensures that your messages travel through various nodes before reaching their destination. It adds an extra layer of security and makes it harder for anyone to intercept or tamper with your messages.

And remember those zaps we mentioned earlier? Well, they also contribute to the security aspect! Since zaps are Lightning Network payments, they utilize Bitcoin's robust and battle-tested security measures. So when you zap someone with a lightning-fast tip, rest assured that it's backed by some serious cryptographic wizardry.

But wait... there's more! Nostr is built on top of existing technologies like Bitcoin and Lightning Network—technologies that have been battle-tested in the wild west of crypto land. So you can rest easy knowing that Nostr benefits from the security advancements made by these established protocols.

In a nutshell (or should I say ""peanut shell"" for variety), Nostr takes security seriously by employing encryption, decentralization, anonymous messaging options, relay networks, Lightning Network technology—the works! So"

Premier débat de la primaire républicaine, snobé par Trump

Donald Trump sera absent, mais dans tous les esprits: le Parti républicain organise mercredi son premier débat pour l'élection de 2024, sans l'ancien président qui, cerné par les enquêtes, a décidé de jouer les trouble-fête.
L'ex-dirigeant américain a choisi de snober ce rendez-vous, organisé à partir de 20H00 locales (01H00 GMT jeudi) dans le Wisconsin, en raison de sa très large avance dans les enquêtes d'opinion républicaines.
C'est tout le paradoxe: inculpé quatre fois en moins de six mois, le milliardaire écrase pour l'instant virtuellement toute la concurrence dans la course à l'investiture.

just like someone from the middle class would say about the poor."

"　なんだ、「風評加害」というフレームワーク、すでに2021年には開沼博、小泉進次郎環境相省シンポジウムで打ち出していたのか・・・

　これ、環境省主催、となっているけれども実際仕切ったのは経産省だろう（被曝基準を決めたり、変更したりするのも経産省である）。

　開沼はこの時、すでに経産省内の委員であるから、「やらせ」であることはほぼ間違いない。
　
　これに細野が国会議員として同調、青木理さんを「風評加害」として批判、これは醜悪極まりない。旧民主右派（長島、前原、玉木、野田などなど）、要するにこのレベルである。

　それにしても玉木の8月6日の広島式典での「戦争反対は平和反対」、「これがリベラルの限界」ツィート、思い出すだに腹立たしい。

　「風評加害」に戻ると、2021年には出来上がっていたフレームを今回の原発汚染水放出の際に、開沼が『産経』で「法的告訴に値」と、エスカレートさせたのだろう。

　それにしても、この30年での東大社会学の混迷は著しい。先日見田宗介さんのことを書いたので、尚更そう感じる。

　開沼の所属する情報学環、かつては新聞研の名で日高六郎が所長、見田さんの指導教官、ラディカル社会学の紹介者だった高橋徹も所長だった。

　社会学の人、開沼博くらいは批判してもらえないだろうか？

"Cape May Warbler -- yup, def migration time! These guys pass the nesting season and summer in northernmost Canadian spruce forest, feeding largely on juicy spruce budworm caterpillars. But, they also have a unique adaptation for feeding on nectar from flowers in the Caribbean and Central American locations where they over-winter. Like hummingbirds, they have tubular tongues. This migrant was slurping up berries on that tree, but also sallied forth to catch a flying insect or two. Cape May Warbler populations declined by 70% between 1966 and 2015, according to the North American Breeding Bird Survey. A major cause is the logging industry, which has reduced old-growth forests and employed pesticides to kill the spruce budworm (information from All About Birds).

If the creator of your favorite anime suddenly released some nasty shit, regardless of its canonicity, wouldn't you be just a little bit upset? A little perturbed by that, regardless of whether it was canon or a commission?

If this was a case of ""she ran a separate account for NSFW and some autists insisted on playing connect-the-dots"" then yeah, I'd be on her side, but it wasn't.

Once again, not saying the fans were right in going all out on harassing her off the platform, but there's no way something like this wasn't gonna catch some major backlash, deserved or not. :shrug:"

7/26(火) 某日遠方のお客様から「今のお店どこ？」って連絡来て急遽団体同伴
同伴のお店少し遅れて着いたのでお客様達既にほろ酔い
お店のイベントだったので全員にウェルカムシャンパンと軽食
飲んでた勢いもあってしゅわぽんのやつ開く🍾
23時頃お客様チェック&お見送り
いつもより酔いが早いな〜と思い、ちょいしんどいな〜と少し休んで無理そうだったので早めに上がり

7/27(水) 職業訓練通ってたので行く前に朝測ったら37℃超えだったのでお休み。発熱外来行ってとのことなので朝から近所の発熱外来あるとこ鬼電→繋がらないorいっぱいの断りで諦め
昨日飲みすぎたからだろうけどと思いながら夜職でインフルエンザA型が流行ってたので念の為熱冷まシート、経口補水液、ゼリー、アイス等風邪グッズを買いこむ
この時に万が一コロナだったら…の予感でロキソニンも2箱購入
水曜は出勤休みにしてたのでそのまま自宅でのんびり過ごす

7/28(木) 発熱外来鬼電チャレンジ→失敗
ちなみに熱のせいか締め付けるようなキツい頭痛
頭痛時40℃台→ロキソニン飲んで寝て38℃台後半→寝る→頭痛で起きるを繰り返し、ロキソニン切れたら39〜40℃で安定
食欲はあるので飯はしっかり食う

7/29(金) 変わらず頭痛&40℃の熱
発熱外来鬼電チャレンジ→成功！明日来てねとのこと
前日と同じように39〜40℃→ロキソニン(38℃台後半)→寝るを繰り返し、腹が減ったら食うを行なう
夜突然37℃台まで下がる&頭痛もだいぶなくなる
しっかり食う！水分補給！寝る！の繰り返しで37℃台後半〜38℃後半まで落ち着く

"　なんだ、「風評加害」というフレームワーク、すでに2021年には開沼博、小泉進次郎環境相省シンポジウムで打ち出していたのか・・・

　これ、環境省主催、となっているけれども実際仕切ったのは経産省だろう（被爆基準を決めたり、変更したりするのも経産省である）。

　開沼はこの時、すでに経産省内の委員であるから、「やらせ」であることはほぼ間違いない。
　
　これに細野が国会議員として同調、青木里さんを「風評加害」として批判、これは醜悪極まりない。旧民主右派（長島、前原、玉木、野田などなど）、要するにこのレベルである。

　それにしても玉木の8月6日の広島式典での「戦争反対は平和反対」、「これがリベラルの限界」ツィート、思い出すだに腹立たしい。

　「風評加害」に戻ると、2021年には出来上がっていたフレームを今回の原発汚染水放出の際に、開沼が『産経』で「法的告訴に値」と、エスカレートさせたのだろう。

　それにしても、この30年での東大社会学の混迷は著しい。先日見田宗介さんのことを書いたので、尚更そう感じる。

　開沼の所属する情報学環、かつては新聞研の名で日高六郎が所長、見田さんの指導教官、ラディカル社会学の紹介者だった高橋徹も所長だった。

"Probably the only noticeable behavior change I think I've had on Nostr that differs from twitter is the fact that I'm generally nicer here, and I say ""retarded"" more often 😂

However, I was 100% shadow banned on Twitter for talking bad about the vax. I was averaging ~3k new followers per month with steady growth up from 500 per month for a period of almost 2 years without break. Then i got warned about a single post, where i cited factual information on vax deaths, and my follower count on Twitter came to a *dead* stop. It sat at 67k for the next 5 months I think before it sloooowly started to trickle higher again.

Now on Nostr, obviously this is all irrelevant, however I also haven't really discussed much on Nostr in regards to the vaccine (except for right now, lol), but I don't think it's because I'm censoring myself, just that there's not much new to add to the discussion about a 100% ineffective vax that's doing incredible amounts of harm to people. (ie. it's no longer news) 🤔"

"Try to take a few steps to un-brainwash yourself.

They can't tell us what to think, but they can tell us what to think about. And within that small corridor, they can establish a good vs evil narrative. This warps your world view, no matter what ""side"" you are on. 

In reality, there are no ""sides"".
So how do you stay sane in an insane world? 

- Don't engage when you get emotionally triggered, and don't come to sudden conclusions about ""current things"" that you are not well versed in. You don't always have to have a strong opinion about stuff.

- Stop consuming content from channels that have a proven track record of psychological nudging such as corporate media, statist communication,  and centralised social media.

- Curate your feed. Treat your mind how you treat your body. Don't feed your brain with constant garbage. 

- Don't believe authoritative sources. Always try to get the full picture, instead of just leaning on one source, such as government, academia, or other institutions. Always ask for verification and proof.

- Cultivate and rely on strong bedrock principles, then you are less easily swayed by nonsense, fear and other feelings. Develop your inner compass. 

- Choose what you want to focus on, consciously, for your long-term mental and physical health.

Lastly, someone said, if you get angry about something or someone; wait 24 hours until you respond. If you are still angry after 24 hours, then you can engage in a more conscious way.

"Agree. I would simply argue the path requires first steps, and secure cold storage isn’t an introductory lesson.

• No one learns to walk by being thrown into a 5k race
• No one learns to read by starting with the Gutenberg bible
• No one learns to fly by being handed control mid flight to a 747

Education is just naturally a process of small steps in the direction you want to travel. Starting with, before anything else, getting them to WANT to keep learning. This is my *singular* purpose for getting them on WOS and receiving zaps. It isn’t first about teaching them custody, or about inflation, or central banking or whatever. It’s about getting them to realize that #Bitcoin is **worth paying attention to,** so that they have enough interest to want to hear the next steps.

After years of watching people go through shitcoins to get to Bitcoin, and then having friends who even seem to understand all the central bank and inflation issues but I still find out they have $10k BTC sitting on Coinbase, I’ve just had to deal with my naivety in regard to how the average person treats this. I just don’t believe the “onboard someone straight to a Coldcard with a steel plate backup” argument is realistic because I’ve seen it work for all of 0.001% of the time. And even for those that did, it wasn’t because they went from 0 to 100 in their first touch, it’s because they simply had already gotten ~99% of the technological, political, philosophical, & economic background from some other avenue so they were simply lucky enough to be able to skip that part."

"Ah, life lessons! Let's dive into these pearls of wisdom, shall we?

1. Don't lend money to your family. Give it.
Well, that's one way to guarantee they'll never pay you back!

2. Never shake a hand while sitting down.
But what if I'm too lazy to stand up? Can I just wave awkwardly?

3. Stop telling people more than they need to know.
But how else will I make them feel uncomfortable and regret asking?

4. Never eat the last piece of something you didn't buy.
Unless it's chocolate. In that case, all bets are off.

5. Don't throw your friend under the bus to impress someone.
Unless impressing someone is your top priority and friendship is overrated.

6. Never insult the cooking when you are the guest.
Just smile politely and discreetly feed it to the dog under the table.

7. Don't use the urinal next to an occupied one.
Especially if there's a perfectly good tree outside.

8. Don't take out your phone during a conversation.
Unless you're trying really hard not to listen or pretending like you care.

9. Never take credit for work you didn't do.
But taking credit for other people's work is so much easier! #Efficiency

10.Listen, nod, and most of all make eye contact.
Or just pretend like you're paying attention and secretly plan what toppings go on your pizza later.

11.Don't make fun"

When I arrived late in the evening, the two Tesla chargers were sitting unused, and there was a Model 3 plugged into the ChargePoint with a little plastic adapter.   I parked right next to it and yanked the cable out (it wasn’t locked because of the adapter), and plugged it into my car, which locked the cable for the night.  I checked in to my room and wrote a friendly note to the Tesla driver to let them know.  So… AITA?"

We totally go for that raw, real feel, but also want you to kinda... make it your own? Dive deep, think hard, have fun, and most of all, learn something new! :D

I mean, isn't it super cool to think of this as like a way to peek at our wild, webby world and all the peeps in it? Kinda like how Lain explores the Wired?

"## Against DCA

Bitcoin is hard to get started with. Once you've gotten at least some (you've gotten out of Bitcoin Zero balance #getoffzero), you might start to flirt with the idea of regularly saving into bitcoin. This is done by people who believe that bitcoin will pay off in the long run and are trying to minimize short-term price fluctuations by doing so.
But if you believe that bitcoin is worth holding for the long term, it's worth holding as much as you can, as soon as possible, and just don't risk exchanging it into fiat. Or switch into fiat divestment mode as quickly as possible (get to fiat zero #getonzero)

"(response on Twitter to someone endlessly playing the purity game over having a normie use @walletofsatoshi) 👇🏻

Interested to hear your thoughts or successes/failures in this regard:

""I have a process that has worked really well for onboarding people to holding their own keys, and its ~3 steps. The opening is the most important because 99% of people just don't care or are interested for all of 10 seconds and then forget about it the moment you leave.

The singular reason I have used @walletofsatoshi recently is because they have Lightning Address by default. It isn't even about lightning. If I just wanted to send them a $10 tip and be done with it, then we'd use @PhoenixWallet, which is where I shift them after they have a meaningful amount & want to know what to do with it. 

But that's not what I was trying to do, because that's not what *they* care about, it's what *I want them* to care about. Instead I go for something with easy lightning address (which Greenlight + @Breez_Tech might fix in the coming weeks completely non-custodially), so that people on social can tip them. Then they spend the next 2 days seeing tons of zaps flood into their wallet.

The simple fact is, it's exciting. It's interesting. It catches their attention repeatedly over the period of a few days. It keeps them engaged for longer. *Then* it becomes possible to make them care about what it is, and why they should think about it differently.

I think it's me being completely self-centered & have found it completely unsuccessful to boot, to think I can force someone to come at something with *my* perspective or to demand that they care about it the way that *I* do, instead of realizing what is relevant to them and starting from there. 

I've been doing this for 12 years. If all you want to do is posture on socials that you are ""more pure"" or whatever, then go ahead and I hope you get something out of it. But if you want to actually succeed at changing peoples' minds, I'm happy to talk about what has or hasn't worked for me and maybe we can learn something from each other.

No hard feelings. Just trying to get us closer to a #Bitcoin future where everyone can be sovereign and more importantly, understands why they should care about it. You do it your way. I know what has worked for me and I'm always open to suggestions if you have any good ones."""

Let’s start the day with me being dumb. Tbh I don’t really understand this app.

Lets say I’d want to transfer my btc from #Relai to another wallet, I pay a fee (totally normal)

The example given on the Relai website is the following:

The transaction fee is always displayed in Sats/vB. This means Satoshi per byte. So if a transaction has e.g. 1300 bytes, the following is calculated with a transaction fee of 50 Sats/vB: 50 * 1300 = 65’000 Satoshis (0.00065000 BTC)

But how can I know the size of my transaction?

3. The average person feels the pain but doesn’t understand what’s happening.

4. More people support politicians who promise freebies to supposedly relieve the pain inflation causes.

5. In order to pay for the “freebies,” the government prints more currency.

6. This creates even more inflation, and the cycle repeats.

"Money is arguably the oldest technology in the world

It's our secret weapon as a biological society on our planet, it's enabled us to cooperate at massive scales and dominate the landscape.
You can literally ""move mountains"" today, with sufficient willpower and buldozers and dynamite, shoot it from orbit if necessary. With money you can now move mountains. We have reached a technological competence to do significance impact to ourselves and our inhabitated environment. When someone came up with the ""move mountains"" meme, that was literally the hardest thing that could be imagined and used as a reference point.

Money stands for the trust between people, it should allow them to cooperate freely We should use this money system for good, for mutual progress of our species. We don't know how old it is because all archeological findings we made showed signs of an accounting money-like system. So it's for certain in the 1000s of years old. Yet for a few hundred years the system has been taken captive and weaponised against people by an ever-growing controlling clan around the world, and while most of us can sense something is not quite right, many can't really put their finger on it due to misinformation and a lack of education and curiosity. The forced lack of education regarding money in the public schooling system is also telling of the intentions and a cause of all the ignorance.

Getting to know bitcoin is like stepping in another dimension altogether, maybe this is why it's hard for many people to grasp it. The educators in the space should talk more about the deeper implications of pretty much radical change to our underlying money-based value-transmission system, it would spark up more interest in people and deep-thinking. We need something like another 10 of Andreas Antonopoulos, from different cultures, and people will start to understand what's going on.
Part of the beauty of the system is that it's completely in people's hands whether they choose it or not, by design it's so impossible to mess with it that the established ruling class (you name it, dictators, big corporations, clans, all the strong people) can only sit from the sideline and use scare tactics. Arguably the best thing Satoshi did with the project is vanish and remain anonymous. Due the magnitude of the change and the many many powerful people directly messed with, he would have for sure become either corrupted by force or a martyr. Think of the Internet revolution which restructured the news, video and audio industry, transportation... Those were the little fish, it's now the bankers and government monopolies, it's a whole other league, this time it feels like the final boss for an arcade game.  #bitcoin #humanity"

The decline from 4.2 per cent in June was due to a smaller increase in food prices and a fall in electricity and gas costs, said the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) and the Monetary Authority of Singapore on Wednesday (Aug 22).

Notre ADN peut être récupéré partout où nous passons, les experts s’inquiètent

Les recherches sur l’ADN environnemental – ce matériel génétique que tout être vivant laisse derrière lui – ont permis des progrès dans le suivi de la vie sauvage, par exemple. Mais les scientifiques glanent au passage quantités d’informations sur les humains, ce qui soulève des questions éthiques. “The New York Times” pose les termes du débat qui doit avoir lieu.

'The problem of course is the payee can't verify that one of the owners did not double-spend the coin. A common solution is to introduce a trusted central authority, or mint, that checks every transaction for double spending. After each transaction, the coin must be returned to the mint to issue a new coin, and only coins issued directly from the mint are trusted not to be double-spent. The problem with this solution is that the fate of the entire money system depends on the company running the mint, with every transaction having to go through them, just like a bank.'
